#United States

Many software projects need a list of the USA states for one reason or another.

We've scoured the web for lists of states and abbreviations more than once. It's not hard work, but it is work. So, we've implemented a state listing and lookup API in some programming languages for our and your convenience.

Just grab the file that you need and let the good times roll.

###API Features

- Get a listing of states and/or other USA political divisions (DC, insular areas, freely associated states, military zones)
- Lookup names by abbreviations
- Lookup abbreviations by name

###Current Implementations

- Javascript (compiled from TypeScript)
  - sample: http://jsfiddle.net/Q6tkB/23/
- C#
- SQL

###TODO

- More languages:
  - Java
  - Ruby
  - Python
  - Flat file (also to act as the master list)
  - Any others that can be thought of
- Automated build all implementations from master flat file

Pull requests for other language implementations, new features, or missing political divisions are very welcome.
